# TDD: Write Better Code Faster
This repository is the source code for my presentation *Test Driven Development: Write Better Code Faster*.

## Running the presentation

To build the presentation run `npm run build` or `npm run start` (which starts a server so that you can view the presentation on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Abstract

In this presentation I argue that Test Driven Development, as an engineering
process, generally both speeds up your development cycle and improves the
quality of the resulting software.

The instinctive reaction to writing tests is that it's a lot of extra work,
and many software engineers wonder if it's really worth the effort.  

Moreover, many people don't understand the difference between "writing tests"
(which is a programming task) and "Test Driven Development", which is an
engineering process.
